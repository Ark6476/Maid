Maid is a little python script I wrote for keeping things tidy on my linux servers.


Example:
Let's say you wanted to remove log files that were older than a month old. However, you don't want to delete the latest log file. All you have to do is edit your maidconf file (located in either /etc/maidconf ~/.maidconf) as such:

[Clean up old log files]
directory=/path/to/log/files
match=foo.log.* #regular expression
age=0y-1m-0d-0h-0m
keep=1
action=rm -f


Maid can be combined with cron to periodicly organize files.
